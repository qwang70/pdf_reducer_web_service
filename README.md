### Reduce your PDFs with duplicated pages into a single consice version with duplicated pages removed!
Slides provided by professors in PDF format usually contain duplicated or similar contents from multiple continuous pages due to the process of conversion from PowerPoint to PDF. It makes viewing PDF slides inefficient, and makes printing rather paper-consuming. PDF Reducer online service provides a tool designed for students that features in quick duplicated slides reducing, along with other traditional PDF manipulation features, such as preview and merging.
